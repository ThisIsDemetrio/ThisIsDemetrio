### Hi there 👋

So, yeah, that's me.

🧑‍💻 I live in *Milan, Italy* and I write code for living. 
<br>🧪 That's a choice of life coming in 2017: before of that, I was a *chemist*.

I like a lot of stuff, like:
- 🚴 bike-touring
- ♘ chess
- 🏀 sports (just to watch)
- 🍻 beer
- 🔰 try to speak foreign languages
- 🀄 mah-jong
- 🤼‍♂️ sumo (just watching)

(not necessarily in this order)

#### Right now...

- 🎵 the song I'm hooked to is [*Your Woman* by *White Town*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIX2RAHPTsI)
- 📖 reading [Python Design Patterns](https://python-patterns.guide/) (actually, not a book)
- 🍿 I'm watching [Succession](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7660850/) and [Game Changer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11011104/)
- 📚 Studying AI (mainly from [DeepLearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)) and System Design and Architecture
- 🎮 on spare time I'm playing [Tactics Ogre: Reborn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1451090/Tactics_Ogre_Reborn/) and chess on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/)
- 💻 working on personal projects with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), plus [Golang](https://go.dev/)
- 👾 wishing having enough time/will to write small videogames with [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io/) (I actually have a repo somewhere...)

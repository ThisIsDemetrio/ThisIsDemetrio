### Hi there 👋

So, yeah, that's me.

🧑‍💻 I live in *Milan, Italy* and I write code for living. 
<br>
🧪 That's a life choice I made in 2017: before that, I was a *chemist*.

I enjoy a lot of things, like:
- 🚴 bike-touring
- ♘ chess
- 🏀 sports (just watching)
- 🍻 beer
- 🔰 try to speak foreign languages
- 🀄 mah-jong
- 🤼‍♂️ sumo (just watching)

(not necessarily in this order)

#### Right now...

- 🎵 the song I'm hooked to is [*Evolution Revolution Love* by *Tricky*]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIX2RAHPTsI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWIeVTs94rI))
- 📖 reading [Python Design Patterns](https://python-patterns.guide/) (technically, not a book) and [The Copenhagen Book](https://thecopenhagenbook.com/) (again, not a book)
- 🍿 I'm watching [Fargo]([https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7660850/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fargo_(TV_series))) and anything from [Dropout.tv](https://dropout.tv/)
- 📚 Studying AI (mainly from [DeepLearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/)) and System Design and Architecture
- 🎮 in my spare time I'm playing [Tactics Ogre: Reborn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1451090/Tactics_Ogre_Reborn/) and chess on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/)
- 💻 I'm working on personal projects with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), plus [Golang](https://go.dev/)
- 👾 I wish I had enough time/will to write small videogames with [Phaser.io](https://phaser.io/) (I actually have a repo somewhere...)
